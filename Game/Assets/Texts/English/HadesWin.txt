You weren't up to the task, then...
I was counting on you and your potential.
Yet another life wasted for nothing.
So, I will start everything over from the beginning.
This endless loop will never stop, it seems.
Rest in peace, my dear Zephyr.
I know that your soul yearned for vengeance...
But... it is not what He want.
