Here is the punishment that has been reserved for my sins...
I wasn't wrong in choosing you.
We could have become the two greatest beings in the universe...
But well, everything has an end...
After all.
It's all his fault; he won't let you leave here.
He uses you as he used me.
You and I are alike; we couldn't carve out our own destinies...

Be ready for what comes next; he's watching every move and choice you make.
Don't become his ideal. I'm counting on you to take over.
Fare____well.
Hoping that you forgive me for what I made you endure.
