But who do we have here!
Welcome, Zephyr! You must be wondering how I know your name, but that's not very important.
Firstly, let me introduce myself. I am Hades, the king of the underworld.
Yes, welcome to my abode where suffering, blood, and death reign.
Lately, chaos has been prevailing too much in the underworld, encroaching upon that of humans.
The reason for your death, by the way...
Your presence here is significant; I have chosen you to restore order between the two worlds.
Kill all the demons that stand in your way and restore order.
To assist you in your quest, here is a useful weapon against demons and a very special power.
Your power is none other than the deadly sin of wrath.
It will prove very useful in certain situations.
Time is of the essence, be strong and courageous.
And remember, the balance between the two worlds must be restored.
